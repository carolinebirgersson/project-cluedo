# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

The brief was to create a Cluedo game.

After this week I'm able to create objects and arrays and loops through arrays. I also know more about functions. 

I learned:
– How to use Arrays in JavaScript
– How to use forEach-loops in JavaScript
– How to use objects in JavaScript
– Knowledge about closures and scope in JavaScript

## The problem

If I had more time I would have added more details when clicking on a card.
